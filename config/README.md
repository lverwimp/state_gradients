# Config files used in papers

The config files used in the Interspeech paper is the following:

[ptb-norm-wsj_64e_256h_steps50.config](ptb-norm-wsj_64e_256h_steps50.config)

This trains a baseline PTB model with sequence length = 50.

The config files used in the paper submitted to Computer Speech and Language are the following:
* ptb-norm-wsj_64e_256h_steps200.config: This trains the same baseline model but with sequence length = 200.
* ptb-norm-wsj_pretr-wsj_64e_256h_steps200.config: Train the baseline model but with pre-trained WSJ embeddings
